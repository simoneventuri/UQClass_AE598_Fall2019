# UQClass_AE598_Fall2019

## Slides and Jupyter Notebook files for the invited lectures "An Introduction to  Uncertainty Quantification for Predictive Science", Prof. M. Panesi's Uncertainty Quantification class (AE598), UIUC, Fall 2019

### The slides are divided in Part I and II
### The Jupyter Notebook files are Theano + PyMC3 implementations of three probabilistic models for a mass-spring-damper sytem, with (hyper-)parameters reconstructed via Bayesian inference (MCMC). The goal is to quantify the uncertainty affecting the prediction of design quantities of interest (QoIs) due to parameter, model, and observation errors.
